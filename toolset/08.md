### Lab Objective

The objective of this lab is utilize tools and commands to solve non-trivial command line tasks.

#### 1. climystery
There's been a murder in Terminal City, and TCPD needs your help.

To figure out whodunit, you need access to a command line.

Once you're ready, connect to the TCPD mainframe with the credentials your instructor provided.

Open a browser, go to [http://192.168.210.242:4200](http://192.168.210.242:4200), and you will be prompted for your username and password.

Once logged in you will see a folder `climystery`, in it are your instructions.

One way you can do this is with these commands:
 
    detective@TCPD-mainframe:~$ cd climystery
    detective@TCPD-mainframe:~$ cat instructions

(`cat` is a command that will print the contents of the file called `instructions` for you to read.)

To get started on how to use the command line, open [cheatsheet.pdf](../cheatsheet.pdf) 

Don't use a text editor to view any files except these instructions, the cheatsheet, and hints.
